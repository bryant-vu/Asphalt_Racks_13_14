# Asphalt_Racks_13_14
SAM Reporting
Asphalt_Loading_Racks_13_14.exe is intended for use during LTR”s SAM reporting.

The following provides background information:

1) LTR’s Scale Reports program records data on asphalt product loaded via Racks 13 and 14.

2) LTR reduces throughput data each semi-annual period to ensure no throughput (C1.11) or temperature (C6.5) exceedances.

3) The program will output an Excel file titled “YYYY_MM to YYYY_MM_Racks 13 & 14_C1.11 & C6.5” at the location of the “rptRackReport_13_14” file. (For example, if the “rptRackReport_13_14” file is located in a folder titled “Data”, the program will create “YYYY_MM to YYYY_MM_Racks 13 & 14_C1.11 &C6.5” in the “Data” folder).

4) The program will also accept a file with the name “rptRackReport” but be sure the file contains data for Racks 13 and 14.
